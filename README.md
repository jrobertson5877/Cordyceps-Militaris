## Work in Progress
Command and Control server plus agents for linux and windows operating systems (ideally kern >5.0 && win10^). The project is something I've been wanting to write for a very long time. I've had the idea in my mind to try and rewrite the wheel to not only educate myself on languages such as Python3, C/C++, C#, .NET and the respective Linux and Windows operating systems. I took inspiration from many blogs and basic tutorials before me, so credit to all those who want to see the InfoSec community grow, and red team ops succeed. Salud.
